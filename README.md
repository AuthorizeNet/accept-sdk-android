# Authorize.Net Accept Mobile SDK for Android

## SDK Installation

Android Studio is preferred because Eclipse will not be supported by Google much longer.

### Android Studio (or Gradle)

Add this line to your app's `build.gradle` inside the `dependencies` section as follows:

```groovy
    dependencies {
        compile 'net.authorize:accept:+'
    }
```

### Eclipse

1. Download the Android SDK jar file 'authorizenet-accept-android-x.x.x.jar' from 'authorize.net/accept-sdk'.
2. Include the `authorizenet-accept-android-x.x.x.jar` into the `libs` folder of your Android application project.
