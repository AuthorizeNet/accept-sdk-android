# Authorize.Net Accept Mobile SDK for Android  

  
This SDK allows mobile developers to provide credit card payment functionality within their Android applications without having to pass sensitive card data back to their application backend servers.

1. [Getting Started](#getting-started-four-steps)
1. [Demo Applcation](#demo-applcation)

## Installation (One Step)
Add the dependency from jCenter to your app's (not project) `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'net.authorize:accept-android-sdk:+'
}
```

## Getting Started (Four Steps)

### Prerequisites

 Android API 14+ is required as the `minSdkVersion` in your build.gradle


### 1. Initialize AcceptSDKApiClient

 All SDK API's will be accessed through `AcceptSDKApiClient` Object, which can be created as follows:

```java
// Parameters:
// 1) Context - Activity context
// 2) AcceptSDKApiClient.Environment - AUTHORIZE.NET ENVIRONMENT
apiClient = new AcceptSDKApiClient.Builder (getActivity(),
                                          AcceptSDKApiClient.Environment.SANDBOX) 
                                          .connectionTimeout(5000) // optional connection time out in milliseconds
                                          .build();
```

### 2. Prepare Objects rquired to call Token API
 Fetch token API require `EncryptTransactionObject` and it can be created as follows:

```java
 EncryptTransactionObject transactionObject = TransactionObject.
         createTransactionObject(TransactionType.SDK_TRANSACTION_ENCRYPTION)// type of transaction object
        .cardData(prepareCardDataFromFields()) // card data to be encrypted
        .merchantAuthentication(prepareMerchantAuthentication()) //Merchant authentication
        .build();
```

`EncryptTransactionObject` require CardData object and it can be created as follows:

```java
CardData cardData = new CardData.Builder(CARD_NUMBER,
                                               EXPIRATION_MONTH, // MM
                                               EXPIRATION_YEAR) // YYYY
                                               .cvvCode(CARD_CVV) // Optional
                                               .zipCode(ZIP_CODE)// Optional
                                               .cardHolderName(CARD_HOLDER_NAME)// Optional
                                               .build();
```

`EncryptTransactionObject` require Merchant Authentication object and it can be created as follows:

```java
ClientKeyBasedMerchantAuthentication merchantAuthentication = ClientKeyBasedMerchantAuthentication.
                createMerchantAuthentication(API_LOGIN_ID, CLIENT_KEY);
```

Check out "Obtaining a Public Client Key" section in [Accept JS](http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/features/acceptjs.html) 
to get more information getting CLIENT_KEY.

### 3. Calling Token API

When transaction information are ready, you can make following call to fetch token.

```java
// Parameters: 
// 1. EncryptTransactionObject - The transaction object for current transaction
// 2. transaction response callback.
apiClient.getTokenWithRequest(transactionObject, callback);
```

### 4. Implement  EncryptTransactionCallback Interface.

To get a response back, the activity/fragment should implement the `EncryptTransactionCallback` interface. It has following methods.

> [onEncryptionFinished()](#onEncryption-Finished)

> [onErrorReceived()](#onError-Received)

### onEncryptionFinished() 

   This method will be called when token is successfully generated.`EncryptTransactionResponse` object has Data Descriptor and Data value details which will be used to perform payment transaction.
   
```java
@Override
public void onEncryptionFinished(EncryptTransactionResponse response) 
{ 
  Toast.makeText(getActivity(), 
                 response.getDataDescriptor() + " : " + response.getDataValue(),
                 Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
                 .show();
}
```

### onErrorReceived()

   This  method will be called in three senarios,
   
     > Validation of information is failed.
     > Network related errors.
     > API error response.
     
 `ErrorTransactionResponse` may contain one or more error messages.

```java
@Override
public void onErrorReceived(ErrorTransactionResponse errorResponse) 
{ 
 Message error = errorResponse.getFirstErrorMessage();
  Toast.makeText(getActivity(), 
                 error.getMessageCode() + " : " + error.getMessageText() ,
                 Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
                 .show();
}
```

## Sample Applcation

 We have a sample application which demonstrates the SDK usage:

##Google Play In-App Billing API
Googleâ€™s developer terms require that purchases related to the app, such as premium features or credits, are made via their native Google Play In-app Billing API.  See https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html for more details.
